## Suggestions

### Do Accurate Gas Cost Comparison

`To accurately compare gas costs between functions, it is recommended that you do not include them in the same contract.`

Why? üëá

This is because the position of function selectors in the contract can affect gas costs. When a function is called, the EVM searches for the correct function selector using a binary search algorithm. If the correct function selector is located closer to the beginning of the list, the search process will require less gas compared to if the correct function selector is located closer to the end of the list.

For example, in the contract below, calling function `a()` may require slightly less gas than calling function `b()`.

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;


contract Example {
  // Execution cost: 337 gas 
  function b() public pure returns(uint){
     return 1;
  }

  // Execution cost: 315 gas 
  function a() public pure returns(uint){
     return 1;
  }
}
```

### Consider both deployment cost and function execution cost 

When designing a smart contract, it is important to consider both the deployment cost and the function execution cost. While a contract with a higher deployment cost may require more gas to be deployed, if it has a lower function execution cost, it may be more cost-effective for users who will be paying for each function execution. Conversely, a contract with a lower deployment cost may seem cheaper at first, but if it has a higher function execution cost, it may end up being more expensive for users in the long run. Therefore, it is important to consider both factors when designing a smart contract.
